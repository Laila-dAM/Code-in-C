This program allows users to convert binary numbers to decimal and decimal numbers to binary. It offers two options: converting a binary string (composed only of '0's and '1's) into its decimal equivalent, or converting a positive decimal integer into its binary representation. The program includes input validation to ensure that binary inputs contain only valid characters and that decimal numbers are positive. Users interact with a simple menu, selecting their desired conversion and receiving the corresponding result.
