This program allows the user to perform basic mathematical operations on matrices, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The user can input two matrices of compatible sizes, and the program will calculate and display the result based on the chosen operation. The program also checks the compatibility of matrix sizes before performing any operation and allows multiple operations to be performed in sequence.
